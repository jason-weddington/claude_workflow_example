# Codebase Structure and Patterns

**FIRST-TIME SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**:

If you're setting up this file for the first time:

1. Analyze the codebase to understand:
   - The main directories and their purposes
   - Code organization and architecture patterns
   - Coding style conventions (naming, formatting, etc.)
   - Common design patterns used in the project
   - Test locations and testing approach
   - Key implementation details for new developers

2. Replace this template with comprehensive documentation based on the codebase analysis.
3. Ask clarifying questions about any aspects that aren't clear from the code alone.
4. Remove these instructions when the documentation is complete.
