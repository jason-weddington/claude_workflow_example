# To-Do List

**IMPORTANT**: This file should contain a simple checklist that maps 1:1 to the tasks in tasks.md. 
Each task from tasks.md should have exactly one corresponding checkbox here using the EXACT SAME task title.
Do NOT create detailed breakdowns or sub-tasks here - keep it simple.

## Tasks from tasks.md

- [ ] Task 1: [Copy exact title from "Task 1" in tasks.md]
- [ ] Task 2: [Copy exact title from "Task 2" in tasks.md]
- [ ] Task 3: [Copy exact title from "Task 3" in tasks.md]
- [ ] Task 4: [Copy exact title from "Task 4" in tasks.md]
- [ ] Task 5: [Copy exact title from "Task 5" in tasks.md]

## Example Format:
If tasks.md has "## Task 1: Set Up Testing Infrastructure", then this file should have:
- [ ] Task 1: Set Up Testing Infrastructure

Use the EXACT same title - copy and paste it to ensure consistency.

NOT detailed sub-items like:
- [ ] Install pytest
- [ ] Create test directories
- [ ] Configure coverage

Those details belong in tasks.md, not here.
