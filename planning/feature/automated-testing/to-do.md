# To-Do List

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

### Setup Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Add pytest and pytest-cov to pyproject.toml as optional dependencies
- [ ] Create tests/ directory structure (unit/, integration/, fixtures/)
- [ ] Create tests/conftest.py with basic configuration
- [ ] Add pytest configuration to pyproject.toml
- [ ] Test basic pytest execution with `pytest` command
- [ ] Configure code coverage reporting

### Create Test Fixtures
- [ ] Create fixture for temporary git repositories
- [ ] Create fixture for temporary directories with cleanup
- [ ] Create sample template files for testing
- [ ] Create utility functions for file/directory comparison
- [ ] Test fixtures work correctly in isolation

## Phase 2: Core Testing (Week 2)

### Unit Tests - CLI Module
- [ ] Test argument parsing for init command
- [ ] Test argument parsing for new command  
- [ ] Test argument parsing for update command
- [ ] Test --amazonq flag handling
- [ ] Test command routing logic
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid arguments
- [ ] Test help message generation
- [ ] Mock file system operations for isolated testing

### Unit Tests - Template Engine
- [ ] Test {{FILENAME}} placeholder substitution
- [ ] Test {{AGENT_NAME}} placeholder substitution
- [ ] Test template reading from package resources
- [ ] Test H1 header removal logic
- [ ] Test line ending handling
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty templates, malformed placeholders)

### Unit Tests - File Operations
- [ ] Test directory creation (mkdir with parents=True)
- [ ] Test file copying operations
- [ ] Test file permission setting
- [ ] Test path handling (absolute vs relative)
- [ ] Test error handling for permission issues
- [ ] Test cleanup operations

### Unit Tests - Git Integration
- [ ] Test .git directory detection
- [ ] Test branch name extraction
- [ ] Test branch-to-directory-path conversion
- [ ] Test non-git directory handling
- [ ] Test user confirmation prompts
- [ ] Test various branch naming patterns

## Phase 3: Integration & Validation (Week 3)

### Integration Tests - Init Command
- [ ] Test complete init workflow (Claude variant)
- [ ] Test complete init workflow (Amazon Q variant)
- [ ] Test directory structure creation
- [ ] Test file content verification
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid directories)
- [ ] Test user confirmation flow

### Integration Tests - New Command
- [ ] Test branch-specific documentation creation
- [ ] Test with feature/ branch names
- [ ] Test with fix/ branch names
- [ ] Test with complex nested branch names
- [ ] Test error handling (not in git repo)
- [ ] Test template file copying verification

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Test invalid file permissions scenarios
- [ ] Test missing template files
- [ ] Test extremely long file paths
- [ ] Test special characters in branch names
- [ ] Test resource cleanup on failures
- [ ] Test partial operation recovery

### Code Coverage & Performance
- [ ] Run coverage analysis and aim for 80%+
- [ ] Optimize slow tests (target <2 minutes total)
- [ ] Fix any flaky or unreliable tests
- [ ] Validate test isolation (no test interdependencies)

## Documentation & Finalization

### Test Documentation
- [ ] Add testing section to README.md
- [ ] Create TESTING.md with detailed guidelines
- [ ] Document pytest configuration and options
- [ ] Include examples of good test patterns
- [ ] Update docs/testing.md with new approach

### Code Quality
- [ ] Review all test code for clarity and maintainability
- [ ] Ensure consistent test naming conventions
- [ ] Add docstrings to complex test functions
- [ ] Remove any debugging code or temporary files

### Validation
- [ ] Run complete test suite multiple times for reliability
- [ ] Test on clean environment (fresh git clone)
- [ ] Verify tests catch actual bugs (introduce intentional bugs)
- [ ] Validate test performance meets targets

## Final Checklist

### Before Merging
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Code coverage meets 80% target
- [ ] Test suite completes in under 2 minutes
- [ ] No test dependencies on external resources
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Test fixtures clean up properly
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] Update codebase.md with testing information
- [ ] Consider adding pre-commit hooks for testing
- [ ] Plan for future test maintenance
- [ ] Document process for adding new tests
