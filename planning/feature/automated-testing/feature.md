# Claude Workflow Framework - Automated Testing Framework

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive automated testing framework for the Claude Workflow Framework using pytest. This will replace the current manual testing approach with automated unit tests, integration tests, and CI/CD pipeline integration to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Business Goals

- **Improve Code Quality**: Catch bugs and regressions before they reach users
- **Enable Confident Development**: Allow developers to make changes without fear of breaking existing functionality
- **Demonstrate Best Practices**: Show users that the framework follows modern software development practices
- **Support Local Development**: Provide fast, reliable testing for local development workflow

## User Stories

- **As a framework developer**, I want automated tests so that I can confidently refactor code and add new features
- **As a framework contributor**, I want a clear testing structure so that I can write tests for my contributions
- **As a framework user**, I want confidence that releases are well-tested so that I can trust the tool in my projects

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ pytest framework integrated with proper configuration
- ✅ Test directory structure established (`tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`)
- ✅ Test fixtures for templates and git repositories
- ✅ Minimum 80% code coverage for core functionality

### Unit Tests
- ✅ CLI argument parsing and validation
- ✅ Template substitution logic (`{{FILENAME}}`, `{{AGENT_NAME}}`)
- ✅ File and directory operations
- ✅ Git repository detection and branch parsing
- ✅ Error handling and user messaging

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Complete `init` command workflow (both Claude and Amazon Q variants)
- ✅ Complete `new` command workflow with various branch types
- ✅ Template file copying and content verification
- ✅ Cross-platform path handling

### Local Development
- ✅ Easy test execution with `pytest` command
- ✅ Code coverage reporting for local development
- ✅ Clear test output and failure reporting

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Framework
- **pytest** as the primary testing framework
- **pytest-cov** for code coverage reporting
- **pytest-mock** for mocking file system operations where needed
- **tempfile** and **shutil** for creating isolated test environments

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── conftest.py              # Shared fixtures and configuration
├── unit/                    # Unit tests for individual functions
│   ├── test_cli.py          # CLI argument parsing and routing
│   ├── test_template_engine.py  # Template substitution logic
│   └── test_file_operations.py  # File and directory operations
├── integration/             # Integration tests for complete workflows
│   ├── test_init_command.py     # Full init command testing
│   ├── test_new_command.py      # Full new command testing
│   └── test_cross_platform.py  # Platform-specific testing
└── fixtures/                # Test data and fixtures
    ├── templates/           # Sample template files
    └── repositories/        # Git repository fixtures
```

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage of core functions
- **Integration Tests**: 100% coverage of CLI commands
- **Edge Cases**: Error conditions, invalid inputs, permission issues
- **Local Testing**: Fast, reliable test execution for development workflow

## Constraints

### Backward Compatibility
- Tests must not break existing functionality
- New test dependencies should be development-only (not required for end users)
- Testing should not modify the existing CLI interface

### Performance
- Test suite should complete in under 5 minutes on CI
- Individual tests should be fast (< 1 second each for unit tests)
- Integration tests can be slower but should still be reasonable (< 30 seconds each)

### Maintenance
- Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
- Test fixtures should be reusable across multiple test cases
- Clear documentation for adding new tests

## Out of Scope

### Not Included in This Feature
- **Performance/Load Testing**: CLI tool doesn't need performance testing
- **Security Testing**: No security-sensitive operations in scope
- **End-to-End User Testing**: Focus on functionality, not user experience
- **Mutation Testing**: Advanced testing techniques can be added later
- **Property-Based Testing**: Can be considered for future enhancements

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with code quality tools (pylint, black, mypy)
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Performance benchmarking for large repositories
- User acceptance testing framework

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Set up pytest configuration and basic test structure
2. Create test fixtures for templates and git repositories
3. Implement basic unit tests for core functions
4. Establish code coverage baseline

### Phase 2: Core Testing (Week 2)
1. Complete unit test coverage for CLI module
2. Implement integration tests for init and new commands
3. Add error handling and edge case tests
4. Achieve 80%+ code coverage

### Phase 3: Validation and Documentation (Week 3)
1. Run comprehensive test validation
2. Optimize test performance and reliability
3. Update documentation with testing guidelines
4. Create developer guidelines for writing tests

## Success Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: Achieve and maintain 80%+ test coverage
- **Test Performance**: Complete test suite in under 2 minutes locally
- **Developer Confidence**: Ability to refactor code without manual testing
- **Regression Prevention**: Catch breaking changes before release
- **Test Reliability**: Consistent test results across runs

## Timeline

- **Start Date**: Current (August 2025)
- **Phase 1 Completion**: 1 week from start
- **Phase 2 Completion**: 2 weeks from start  
- **Phase 3 Completion**: 3 weeks from start
- **Target Completion**: 3 weeks from start

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies on other features
- Requires pytest and pytest-cov packages (development dependencies only)
