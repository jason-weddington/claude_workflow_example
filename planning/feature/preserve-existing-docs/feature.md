# Feature: Preserve Existing Docs Directory

## Overview
When initializing the Claude Workflow Framework in a project that already has a `./docs` directory, the framework should preserve the existing directory and add our template files to it, rather than creating a new docs directory or potentially overwriting existing documentation.

## Business Goals
- **Preserve existing documentation** - Don't disrupt projects that already have documentation
- **Seamless integration** - Make the framework work well with existing project structures
- **Non-destructive initialization** - Ensure init command never destroys existing work
- **Better user experience** - Reduce friction when adopting the framework in existing projects

## User Stories
- As a developer with an existing project that has documentation, I want to add the Claude Workflow Framework without losing my existing docs
- As a team lead, I want to ensure that adopting the framework doesn't disrupt our existing documentation structure
- As a project maintainer, I want the framework to integrate cleanly with our existing tooling and documentation

## Current Behavior
Currently, the `claude-workflow init` command creates a new `docs/` directory and copies template files into it. If a `docs/` directory already exists, the behavior is unclear and may cause issues.

## Desired Behavior
When `claude-workflow init` is run:
1. **If `./docs` doesn't exist**: Create it and add template files (current behavior)
2. **If `./docs` already exists**: Add template files to the existing directory, but only if they don't already exist (preserve existing files)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Existing `docs/` directory is preserved during init
- [ ] Template files are added to existing `docs/` directory
- [ ] Existing files in `docs/` are never overwritten
- [ ] New template files are only created if they don't already exist
- [ ] Behavior is consistent whether `docs/` exists or not
- [ ] User is informed about what files were added vs. skipped

## Technical Considerations
- Need to check if `docs/` directory exists before creating it
- Need to check if individual template files exist before copying them
- Should provide user feedback about what was added vs. what was skipped
- Maintain backward compatibility with projects that don't have existing docs

## Success Metrics
- Init command works seamlessly on projects with existing `docs/` directories
- No existing documentation is lost or overwritten
- Users can successfully adopt the framework in existing projects
- Framework integrates cleanly with existing project structures
